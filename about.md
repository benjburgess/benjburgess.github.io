As far back as I can remember, I've always been looking for patterns to try and understand the world around me. Over the past few years I've had the opportunity to take this love of exploring data further by studying and researching natural systems (which also happen to be include some of the most complex datasets and patterns around!). **I've recently been awarded a PhD in computational ecology from UCL**, where I've had the privilege of being supervised by top academics both at **UCL and DeepMind (Google)**. Over the course of my PhD, I've been researching how multiple perturbations (i.e., stressors) affect complex systems. To do this, I've been implementing a wide variety of **computational and statistical approaches to analyse large-scale datasets** (often developing novel methods along the way!). Over the last few years I've **actively developed collaborations** with researchers at institutions both in the UK and further afield (e.g., Cambridge, Oxford, Toronto). Furthermore, the results I've obtained over the course of my PhD have been novel and provided new insights to the field - including answering some of the most pressing questions in multiple stressor ecology. This research has been published in high impact journals (see [*publications*](https://benjburgess.github.io/publications/)) and I've also written an R package which simplifies a range of complex statistical analyses for other researchers in the field (see [*multiplestressR*](https://benjburgess.github.io/multiplestressR/)).
<br />
<br />
**I'm currently looking for new challenges in Health Economics and Outcomes Research** which will allow me to implement my **wide-ranging analytical skills**. I have extensive experience in **R** and **statistics** with a particular emphasis on **evidence synthesis and meta-analyses**. Indeed, **I'm keen to use my knowledge of meta-analyses (both pairwise and network) in a healthcare consultancy environment**. 
<br />
<br />
More generally, I love **problem solving** and frequently undertake **self-directed learning** to improve and diversify my skillsets. I'm likewise **highly involved in the workplace community**, having organised fornightly departmental activities alongside social events. I've also taken on additional responsibilities alongside my PhD, **demonstrating statistics and R** on various undergraduate and postgraduate courses for over three years. I've additionally **co-supervised three undergraduate dissertations**, with one student being awarded a prize for the best third year project.
