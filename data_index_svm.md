## Introduction

Support vector machines (SVMs) are a relatively commonplace machine learning method used to classify data into two or more classes. Outlined below is an introduction to SVMs. However, I have also written a [SVM tutorial (with R code)](https://benjburgess.github.io/i/SVM1), which is available from links both here and at the bottom of this page.


*I'm currently writing this introductory explantion of SVMs - Check back soon!*


## Support Vector Machine - R Tutorial

As described above, a tutorial in R on SVMs is available from the below link. The tutorial utilises on an openly available dataset on wine. This example generates a SVM which is capable of accurately determining the quality of wine based on its chemical properties.
