# Support Vector Machines

## Introduction

Support vector machines (SVMs) are a relatively commonplace machine learning method used to classify data into two or more classes. Outlined below is an introduction to SVMs. However, I have also written two tutorials in R which provide an [introductory](https://benjburgess.github.io/i/SVM_linear) and more [advanced](https://benjburgess.github.io/i/SVM_radial) examples of how support vector machines can be implemented. These tutorials are available both from the links here and at the bottom of this page.

## Support Vector Machine - R Tutorials

As described at the start of this page, there are two tutorials on how SVMs can be implemented in R. These tutorials are described more below.


### Introductory Tutorial

The [introductory tutorial](https://benjburgess.github.io/i/SVM_linear) builds a simple SVM capable of accurately classifying two different species based on data for their heights and weights. This provides an example of how to implement an SVM in R, and some basic examples of data cleaning which is required prior to any analysis.

### Advanced Tutorial

The [advanced tutorial](https://benjburgess.github.io/i/SVM_radial) builds a more complex SVM which attempts to classify wines into different quality classes based upon chemical data for each wine. This tutorial outlines some advanced data cleaning (e.g., SCUT) and explores the potential limitations of SVMs.
