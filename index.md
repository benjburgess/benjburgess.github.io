I'm **Ben Burgess**, and I've recently completed my **PhD in Computational Ecology at UCL**.  
  
Over the past four years I've been using a variety of **computational and statistical approaches** to 
explore how multiple perturbations affect complex systems. 
I've made some really interesting discoveries over this time, including finding 
consistent patterns across a variety of disparate large-scale datasets.  
  
I love **problem-solving**. It would be figuring out how to code a new analysis in **R**, **helping others** overcome obstacles, or **teaching myself new skills**; through all of these activities I enjoy the overcoming the challenges they present.
