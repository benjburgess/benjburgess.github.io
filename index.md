I'm **Ben Burgess**, and I've recently been awarded a **PhD in Computational Ecology at UCL**.  
  
Over the past four years I've been using a variety of **computational and statistical approaches** to 
explore how multiple perturbations affect complex systems. 
I've made some really interesting (and novel) discoveries over this time. 
For instance, I've been able to show that the contrasting results of a dozen or so high-profile papers are due to 
methodological differences and not ecological or environmental factors as previously assumed. 
  
More broadly, I love **problem-solving**. It could be figuring out how to code a new analysis in **R**, **helping others** overcome obstacles, or **teaching myself new skills**; through all of these activities I enjoy overcoming the challenges they present.
