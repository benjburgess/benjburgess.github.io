I'm Ben Burgess, and I've recently submitted my PhD thesis in Computational Ecology at UCL.  
  
Over the past four years I've been using a variety of computational and 
statistical approaches to explore how multiple perturbations affect complex systems.  
I've made some really interesting discoveries over this time, including finding 
consistent patterns across a variety of disparate large-scale datasets.
